title: "Seismic Brittleness Index Volume 3/3"
subtitle: "Based on Well Logs in Unconventional Reservoirs"
summary: "Brittleness is a major rock property for effective reservoir stimulation in unconventional reservoirs. Differentiating brittle from ductile rocks is key to performing efficient well location and completion. I calculated a brittleness index (BI) volume from surface seismic data, calibrated by well logs, in the Barnett Shale.
