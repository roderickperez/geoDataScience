It was Studer (1827) who first adapted this term to Geology, and from that author has been used to name the filling phase of a geosyncline. Its origin takes place in the formation of sediment layers that accumulate in the ocean floor in laminar form. After their lithification, they are exposed on the surface as the result of geological phenomena, and then eroded.\nThe dominant materials in the \u0026ldquo;flysch\u0026rdquo; series correspond to generally turbiditic facies (Kuenen \u0026amp; Migliorini), characterized by the existence of grain-classification in their layers, that is, there is a rhythmic alternation of hard (cohesive) rocks interspersed with other softer (friable).\nThe Flysh of Guarico, is about the strip of 20 to 30 km wide of the thick flysch sequences of the Guarico Formation that arises from Boca de Uchire in the Anzoategui state to the city of San Carlos in the Cojedes state (about 350 km of length in direction EO).\nThe icnofossils (from the Greek ikhnos: trace, mark) or fossil tracks are individually identifiable fossil ethological structures that reflect to a greater or lesser degree the morphology of the producing organism. The icnotaxones are names used by the icnologists to identify and distinguish morphologically different fossil footprints.\nIn these images we can observe the (reverse) relief, ocassioned by the differential erosion of the lithified materials of the icnite filling and the original substrate.\nTo the north of the Iberian Peninsula, between the Guipuzcoan towns of Deva and Zumaia, is the so-called Ruta del Flysch, one of the most relevant and in which its structure in the world is best appreciated.\nTo read the original and full artilce, please check the full post on LinkedIn\n","date":1553470685,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553470685,"objectID":"e12e205354f4a9521d18da9a9126358f","permalink":"https://roderickperez.github.io/geoDataScience/post/flysh-guarico/","publishdate":"2019-03-24T18:38:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/geoDataScience/post/flysh-guarico/","section":"post","summary":"A *flysch* is a formation of sediment layers that accumulate in the ocean floor in laminar form.
